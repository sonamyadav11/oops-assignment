        "\n",
        "ans: Encapsulation\n",
        "1.Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data and makes the code easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on hiding the complexity of an object's implementation and exposing only the essential details to the user. This simplifies the use of complex systems by providing a clear interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Inheritance\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods or functions to take on multiple forms. It enables the same operation to behave differently on different classes, achieved via method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Decorator\n",
        "decorators are a powerful tool to modify or extend the behavior of functions or classes without modifying their source code. Decorators wrap a function (or method) and add some behavior before or after the wrapped function is executed.\n",
